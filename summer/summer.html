        <p>Summers might be sweaty and a real struggle in most regions. That is why schools close for a few days. In
            these few days, the students are given plenty of homework and projects to complete, but they also get enough
            time to spend on what they love doing. Some students are also encouraged to go to summer camps during this
            vacation for experience and joy. The zeal of summer vacation among students is prominent because they start
            whining for from it weeks before, but once they are in their houses and have to spend the days without
            meeting their friends, the sour taste of missing school begins.

            Parents rarely allow phone calls, but when they do, children grab the opportunity for talking to their
            beloved friends whom they miss terribly. In some schools, the summer vacations occur after the end of exams.
            Whereas in other schools the exams are held after summer vacations, therefore the students also have to
            spend time revising their lessons and prepping for their exams. But a student shouldn’t be the Jack who
            works all day and doesn’t get any time for playing because that will make them dull; instead, they should
            find a little time for relaxation which they can think of as a reward their hard work.</p>
